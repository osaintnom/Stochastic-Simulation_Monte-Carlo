# Understanding Agent Behavior in Real-life Scenarios

This project aims to comprehend how individual agents operate collectively, allowing us to make estimations and illustrate distributions of behaviors in real-life scenarios. While cars may function independently, they react to their surroundings when on a highway. We attempted to recreate this phenomenon using stochastic models and probabilistic distributions. 

This practical project was developed as part of a course to gain insights into predictions and estimations using the Monte Carlo model.
